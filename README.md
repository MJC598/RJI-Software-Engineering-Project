Image Quality Analysis for Mizzou Reynolds Journalism Institute

#### Goal:
We hope to make a classifier for the Columbia Missouri newspaper, The Missourian, that when supplied with images, returns a quality ranking (1-10) for each of the photographs. This will reduce the number of photographs the newspaper has digitally stored and save both time and money. After trained and fully implemented, we hope to distribute it to photographers so that they can upload photos directly to the classifier and have the ranks immediately stored in our database for editor and publisher immediate use. All rights to the pictures are maintained by each of the individual photographers and are not to be distributed commerically. 

#### Dependencies:
1. Idealo
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
4. more to come...

#### Environment Setup:
This project was built using a headless virtual machine manager and commit tracker named augur developed by the CHAOSS open source group. Any trouble setting up the environment should direct questions to them.

#### Examples:
Hope to be provided soon...
